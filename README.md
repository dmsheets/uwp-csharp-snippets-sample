## Introduction

This sample contains a repository of code snippets that show how to use the Microsoft Graph SDK to send email, manage groups, and perform other activities with Office 365 data. It uses the [Microsoft Graph .NET Client Library](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-dotnet) to work with data returned by Microsoft Graph.

This repository shows you how to access multiple resources, including Microsoft Azure Active Directory (AD) and the Office 365 APIs, by making HTTP requests to the Microsoft Graph API in a Windows 10 universal app. 

In addition, the sample uses the [Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Identity.Client/) for authentication. The MSAL SDK provides features for working with the [Azure AD v2.0 endpoint](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/office365/howto/authenticate-Office-365-APIs-using-v2), which enables developers to write a single code flow that handles authentication for both users' work or school (Azure Active Directory)  or personal (Microsoft) accounts.

## Important Note about the MSAL Preview

This library is suitable for use in a production environment. We provide the same production level support for this library as we do our current production libraries. During the preview we may make changes to the API, internal cache format, and other mechanisms of this library, which you will be required to take along with bug fixes or feature improvements. This may impact your application. For instance, a change to the cache format may impact your users, such as requiring them to sign in again. An API change may require you to update your code. When we provide the General Availability release we will require you to update to the General Availability version within six months, as applications written using a preview version of library may no longer work.

These snippets are simple and self-contained, and you can copy and paste them into your own code, whenever appropriate, or use them as a resource for learning how to use the Microsoft Graph client library.

**Note:** If possible, please use this sample with a "non-work" or test account. The sample does not always clean up the created objects in your mailbox and calendar. At this time you'll have to manually remove sample mails and calendar events. Also note that the snippets that get and send messages and that get, create, update, and delete events won't work with all personal accounts. These operations will eventually work when those accounts are updated to work with the Azure AD v2.0 endpoint.

## Prerequisites ##

This sample requires the following:  

  * [Visual Studio 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads) 
  * Windows 10 ([development mode enabled](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/dn706236.aspx))
  * Windows 10 SDK
  * Either a [Microsoft](www.outlook.com) or [Office 365 for business account](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/office365/howto/setup-development-environment#bk_Office365Account).

      
<a name="register"></a>
## Register and configure the app

1. Sign into the [App Registration Portal](https://apps.dev.microsoft.com/) using either your personal or work or school account.  
2. Select **Add an app**.  
3. Enter a name for the app, and select **Create application**. The registration page displays, listing the properties of your app.  
4. Under **Platforms**, select **Add platform**.  
5. Select **Native Application**.  
6. Copy both the Client Id (App Id) and Redirect URI values to the clipboard. You'll need to enter these values into the sample app. The app id is a unique identifier for your app. The redirect URI is a unique URI provided by Windows 10 for each application to ensure that messages sent to that URI are only sent to that application.   
7. Select **Save**.

## Build and debug ##

**Note:** If you see any errors while installing packages during step 2, make sure the local path where you placed the solution is not too long/deep. Moving the solution closer to the root of your drive resolves this issue.

1. After you've loaded the solution in Visual Studio, configure the sample to use the client id and redirectURI that you registered by adding the corresponding values for these keys in the Application.Resources node of the App.xaml file.
![Office 365 UWP Microsoft Graph connect sample](/readme-images/appId_and_redirectURI.png "Client ID value in App.xaml file")`

2.	If you are planning on signing into the sample with a work or school account that does not have admin permissions, you'll need to leave code that requests scopes requiring admin permissions commented out. If these lines aren't commented, you won't be able to sign in with your non-admin work or school account (if you sign in with a personal account, these scope requests are ignored.)

	In the `GetTokenForUserAsync()` method of the `AuthenticationHelper.cs` file, see the following scope requests. Leave these commented unless you're using a work or school account that has admin permissions:

	```
		//"https://graph.microsoft.com/Directory.AccessAsUser.All",
	    //"https://graph.microsoft.com/User.ReadWrite.All",
	    //"https://graph.microsoft.com/Group.ReadWrite.All",
	```

3. Press F5 to build and debug. Run the solution and sign in with either your personal or work or school account.

<a name="run"></a>
## Run the sample

When launched, the app displays a series of boxes representing common user tasks, or 'stories'. Each story is comprised of one or more code snippets. The stories are grouped by the account type and permission level:

- Tasks that are applicable to both work or school and personal accounts, such as getting and sending email, creating files, etc.
- Tasks that are only applicable to work or school accounts, such as getting a user's manager or account photo.
- Tasks that are only applicable to a work or school account with administrative permissions, such as getting group members or creating new user accounts.

Select the stories you want to execute, and choose the run button. You'll be prompted to log in with your work or school or personal account. Be aware that if you log in with an account that doesn't have applicable permissions for the stories you've selected(for example, if you select stories that are applicable only to a work or school account, and then log in with a personal account), those stories will fail.

Each story turns green if it succeeds, and red if it fails. Additional information is sent to the Output window. Select **Ctrl + W,O** to view the Output window and see information about the operation.

##How the sample affects your tenant data
This sample runs commands that create, read, update, or delete data. When running commands that delete or edit data, the sample creates test entities. The sample will leave behind some of these entities on your tenant.

<a name="add-a-snippet"></a>
##Add a snippet

This project includes two snippets files: 

- Groups\GroupSnippets.cs 
- Users\UserSnippets.cs.

If you have a snippet of your own that you would like to run in this project, just follow these three steps:

1. **Add your snippet to the snippets file.** Be sure to include a try/catch block. 

	```cs
	try
	{
		var graphClient = AuthenticationHelper.GetAuthenticatedClient();
	
		var currentUserObject = await graphClient.Me.Request().GetAsync();
		currentUserName = currentUserObject.DisplayName;
	
		if ( currentUserName != null)
		{
			Debug.WriteLine("Got user: " + currentUserName);
		}
	
	}
	
	catch (ServiceException e)
	{
		Debug.WriteLine("We could not get the current user: " + e.Error.Message);
		return null;
	}
	```

2. **Create a story that uses your snippet and add it to the associated stories file.** For example, the `TryGetMeAsync()` story uses the `GetMeAsync()` snippet inside the Users\UserStories.cs file:

	```cs
	public static async Task<bool> TryGetMeAsync()
	{
		var currentUser = await UserSnippets.GetMeAsync();
	
		return currentUser != null;
	}       
	```
	
	Sometimes your story will need to run snippets in addition to the one that you're implementing. For example, if you want to update an event, you can use the `CreateEventAsync()` method to create an event. Then you can update it. Always be sure to use snippets that already exist in the snippets file. If the operation you need doesn't exist, you'll have to create it and then include it in your story. It's a best practice to delete any entities that you create in a story, especially if you're working on anything other than a test or developer tenant.

3. **Add your story to the story collection in MainPageXaml.cs** (inside the `CreateStoryList()` method):

	```cs
	StoryCollection.Add(new StoryDefinition() 
		{ GroupName = "Users", Title = "Get Me",  
			ScopeGroup= "Applicable to personal or work accounts", RunStoryAsync = UserStories.TryGetMeAsync });
	```

Now you can test your snippet. When you run the app, your snippet will appear as a new box in the grid. Select the box for your snippet, and then run it. Use this as an opportunity to debug your snippet.
